# sc2_analytics
Building better data structures and analytical modules to help StarCraft Players analyze their replays and focus improvement


Scripts require an inital yaml configuration file (thus far called US_Excelle.yml) directing the script to where the replays are stored on your filestructure.

If using your own replays, it will look something like this:
replay_path: /mnt/c/Users/Zachary/Documents/StarCraft II/Accounts/1549799/1-S2-1-20401307/Replays/Multiplayer/


If using the replays in this git repository, use
replay_path: ./replays/
